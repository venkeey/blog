A Technical Specification for Computational Vedic AstrologyThis document provides a comprehensive technical blueprint and pseudo-code for the generation of a wide array of Vedic astrological charts, tables, and computational metrics. The following specification is designed to serve as an architectural guide for software development, detailing the logical flow, interdependencies, and data structures necessary to produce the outputs listed in the user query. The approach is modular, breaking down complex astrological calculations into distinct functions that can be chained together in a logical sequence.Section 1: Foundational Data and Initial System SetupThe bedrock of any astrological computation is the accurate determination of planetary and house cusp positions for a specific moment in time and location. This section defines the core functions and data models that form the basis for all subsequent calculations.System Entry Point and High-Level ArchitectureThe entire system is best conceptualized as a dependency graph, where the output of one function serves as the input for another. To manage this complexity, a single, high-level orchestration function is proposed. This function, GenerateAstrologyReport, would take the primary user inputs—birth_time (including date), birth_place (latitude and longitude), and timezone—and then call a sequence of modular functions to produce all the requested outputs. This architecture ensures a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase, allowing for the independent development and testing of each component while maintaining a clear and logical data flow. The pseudo-code for this master function acts as a definitive guide to the overall system's operation.Code snippetFUNCTION GenerateAstrologyReport(birth_time, birth_place, timezone)
  // Step 1: Core Astronomical Calculations
  planet_positions = CalculatePlanetaryPositions(birth_time, birth_place, timezone)
  cusp_positions = CalculateHouseCusps(birth_time, birth_place, timezone)

  // Step 2: First-Level Astrological Chart Generation
  lagna_chart = GenerateLagnaChart(planet_positions, cusp_positions)
  chalit_table = GenerateChalitTable(planet_positions, cusp_positions)
  avkahada_chakra = GenerateAvkahadaChakra(planet_positions)

  // Step 3: Generation of Divisional Charts (Vargas)
  varga_charts = GenerateAllVargaCharts(planet_positions)

  // Step 4: Inter-planetary Relationships and Aspects
  permanent_friendship = GeneratePermanentFriendshipTable()
  temporal_friendship = CalculateTemporalFriendship(planet_positions, cusp_positions)
  fivefold_friendship = CalculateFivefoldFriendship(permanent_friendship, temporal_friendship)
  planetary_aspects = CalculateAllAspects(planet_positions, cusp_positions)

  // Step 5: Advanced Strength and Dignity Calculations
  ashtakvarga_system = GenerateAshtakvargaSystem(planet_positions)
  shodashvarga_dignities = GenerateShodashvargaDignities(varga_charts) // Intermediate step for Shadbala/Vimsopaka
  shadbala_table = CalculateShadBala(planet_positions, cusp_positions, shodashvarga_dignities, planetary_aspects)
  vimsopaka_table = CalculateVimsopakaBala(shodashvarga_dignities)

  // Step 6: Specialized Charts (e.g., Varshphal)
  varshphal_chart = GenerateVarshphalChart(birth_time, birth_place, timezone)

  // Step 7: Consolidate and Return All Data
  report_output = {
    "planetary_positions": planet_positions,
    "cuspal_positions": cusp_positions,
    "lagna_chart": lagna_chart,
    "chalit_table": chalit_table,
    //... all other generated outputs
  }

  RETURN report_output
END FUNCTION
The Core Data Model: Planets and CuspsThe entire system hinges on two foundational sets of data: the precise positions of the celestial bodies and the boundaries of the astrological houses. The calculations for these must be performed with high precision using an astronomical library (e.g., Swiss Ephemeris) that accounts for astronomical phenomena and observer location.Planetary Positions (table format)The first step is to determine the precise location of each planet at the moment of birth. This involves calculating the tropical longitude of the Sun, Moon, and other planets, and then converting these to sidereal longitudes using a chosen Ayanamsha (e.g., Lahiri, Fagan/Bradley). Rahu and Ketu are always 180 degrees apart, and their positions can be derived from the lunar nodes. The output of this function should be a structured collection of PlanetData objects, each containing the key attributes of a planet's position. This structure is essential for all subsequent calculations, including divisional charts and strength analyses.Code snippetFUNCTION CalculatePlanetaryPositions(datetime, lat, long)
  // Utilize an astronomical library to compute tropical longitudes for all planets
  tropical_longitudes = get_tropical_positions(datetime)

  // Apply a specific Ayanamsha to convert tropical to sidereal
  ayanamsa = get_ayanamsa_at_time(datetime)
  sidereal_longitudes = tropical_longitudes - ayanamsa

  // Define the PlanetData structure
  DATA_STRUCTURE PlanetData {
    string name;            // "Sun", "Moon", "Mars", etc.
    float sidereal_longitude;  // 0.0 to 360.0 degrees
    int sidereal_sign;      // 1 (Aries) to 12 (Pisces)
    float sign_longitude;      // 0.0 to 30.0 degrees within the sign
    string nakshatra;       // Name of the Nakshatra
    int nakshatra_pada;       // The specific quarter (pada) of the Nakshatra
  }

  // Populate PlanetData objects for each planet
  planet_list =
  FOREACH planet IN sidereal_longitudes
    planet_data = new PlanetData()
    //... populate fields based on longitude
    planet_list.ADD(planet_data)
  END FOREACH

  RETURN planet_list
END FUNCTION
Cuspal Positions (table format)After determining planetary positions, the next step is to establish the house boundaries. The user's query implicitly requires a specific house system for consistency. A standard approach, such as the Placidus or Equal House system, is used to calculate the longitude of the cusp (beginning) of each of the twelve houses, starting with the Lagna (Ascendant). The Lagna is the most crucial cusp, representing the sign rising on the eastern horizon at the time of birth. The output is a collection of CuspData objects.Code snippetFUNCTION CalculateHouseCusps(datetime, lat, long)
  // Use a house system calculation (e.g., Placidus)
  cusp_longitudes = calculate_cusps(datetime, lat, long, "Placidus")

  // Define the CuspData structure
  DATA_STRUCTURE CuspData {
    int house_number;       // 1 to 12
    float sidereal_longitude;  // Longitude of the cusp
    int sidereal_sign;      // Sign of the cusp
  }

  // Populate CuspData objects
  cusp_list =
  FOREACH house_number, longitude IN cusp_longitudes
    cusp_data = new CuspData()
    //... populate fields
    cusp_list.ADD(cusp_data)
  END FOREACH

  RETURN cusp_list
END FUNCTION
Synthesizing Foundational MetricsWith the core planetary and cusp data, the first level of astrological outputs can be generated. These are the most fundamental charts and tables that provide a direct interpretation of the birth data.Avkahada ChakraThe Avkahada Chakra is a summary table that provides key attributes of the birth chart's essence, primarily based on the Moon's position. This metric is a simple lookup derived from the Moon's Nakshatra and is a foundational summary for high-level analysis.Code snippetFUNCTION GenerateAvkahadaChakra(planet_positions)
  moon_data = planet_positions.get_planet("Moon")
  nakshatra = moon_data.nakshatra
  nakshatra_lord = get_nakshatra_lord(nakshatra)

  // Lookup tables based on Nakshatra
  yoni = lookup_yoni(nakshatra)
  gana = lookup_gana(nakshatra)
  varna = lookup_varna(nakshatra)
  vashya = lookup_vashya(nakshatra)

  RETURN { "Moon Nakshatra": nakshatra, "Lord": nakshatra_lord, "Yoni": yoni, "Gana": gana, "Varna": varna, "Vashya": vashya }
END FUNCTION
Lagna Chart and Chalit TableThe user's request for both a Lagna Chart and a Chalit Table (also known as Bhava Chalit) highlights a critical distinction in Vedic astrology between sign-based and house-based placement. The Lagna Chart is a Rasi chart, where the first house is defined by the sign of the Ascendant. A planet's placement is determined solely by the sign it occupies. In contrast, the Chalit Table re-assigns planets to houses based on their precise longitudinal positions relative to the house cusps. A planet might be in one sign in the Lagna Chart but fall into the preceding or succeeding house in the Chalit Table if it is close to a house cusp. This nuance is vital for accurate house-based predictions.Code snippetFUNCTION GenerateLagnaChart(planet_positions, cusp_positions)
  lagna_sign = cusp_positions.get_house(1).sidereal_sign
  chart_output = new ChartOutput()

  // Planets are placed in signs based on their sign_id
  FOREACH planet IN planet_positions
    sign_of_planet = planet.sidereal_sign
    chart_output.place_planet_in_sign(planet.name, sign_of_planet)
  END FOREACH
  RETURN chart_output
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION GenerateChalitTable(planet_positions, cusp_positions)
  chalit_table = new ChalitOutput()

  // Planets are placed in houses based on their longitude relative to cusps
  FOREACH planet IN planet_positions
    house_of_planet = find_house_for_longitude(planet.sidereal_longitude, cusp_positions)
    chalit_table.place_planet_in_house(planet.name, house_of_planet)
  END FOREACH
  RETURN chalit_table
END FUNCTION
Varshphal Chart (Solar Return Chart)The Varshphal chart is an annual chart that is calculated for the exact moment the Sun returns to its natal longitude each year. The generation of this chart requires a specialized algorithm: a search function that iteratively checks the Sun's position to find the precise moment of its return. Once this moment is found, a new set of Planetary Positions and Cuspal Positions is calculated for that exact date, time, and location, creating a new, temporary birth chart for the year. The output of this function is a new PlanetData and CuspData set, mirroring the foundational data model, which allows it to be processed by the same subsequent functions.Code snippetFUNCTION GenerateVarshphalChart(natal_birth_time, natal_lat, natal_long)
  natal_sun_longitude = CalculatePlanetaryPositions(natal_birth_time, natal_lat, natal_long).get_planet("Sun").sidereal_longitude
  current_year = natal_birth_time.year + 1

  // Start the search around the birth date of the new year
  search_datetime = new DateTime(current_year, natal_birth_time.month, natal_birth_time.day,...)

  // Iteratively adjust time until Sun's longitude matches natal Sun's longitude
  WHILE abs(sun_longitude - natal_sun_longitude) > 0.0001
    sun_longitude = CalculatePlanetaryPositions(search_datetime, natal_lat, natal_long).get_planet("Sun").sidereal_longitude
    search_datetime.add_minutes(1) // Or a more advanced bisection search
  END WHILE

  // The final search_datetime is the precise Varshphal moment
  varshphal_planet_positions = CalculatePlanetaryPositions(search_datetime, natal_lat, natal_long)
  varshphal_cusp_positions = CalculateHouseCusps(search_datetime, natal_lat, natal_long)

  RETURN GenerateLagnaChart(varshphal_planet_positions, varshphal_cusp_positions)
END FUNCTION
Section 2: Algorithmic Generation of Divisional Charts (Vargas)A significant portion of the requested outputs consists of the Shodashvarga (16 divisional charts). Generating these charts from scratch for each request is inefficient and error-prone. A more robust architectural approach involves a single, parameterized function that can generate any varga chart by applying a specific ruleset. This method promotes code reuse, consistency, and scalability.The Universal Vargas AlgorithmThe core principle behind all Vargas is the division of a 30-degree sign into smaller parts. The Universal Vargas Algorithm will take a planet's longitude and a varga_number as input and, using a predefined ruleset, determine the planet's sign in the new divisional chart. This new sign is then used to construct the varga chart. This unified approach, rather than a separate function for each varga, is a key architectural decision for building a robust system.Code snippetFUNCTION GenerateVargaChart(planet_positions, varga_number)
  varga_chart_output = new ChartOutput()
  ruleset = get_varga_ruleset(varga_number)

  FOREACH planet IN planet_positions
    original_sign = planet.sidereal_sign
    sign_longitude_in_degrees = planet.sign_longitude

    // Apply the specific ruleset for the varga number
    varga_sign = ruleset.determine_varga_sign(original_sign, sign_longitude_in_degrees)
    
    // Place the planet in the new varga chart
    varga_chart_output.place_planet_in_sign(planet.name, varga_sign)
  END FOREACH

  RETURN varga_chart_output
END FUNCTION
Pseudo-code for Key Divisional ChartsThe universal function above is implemented by providing a specific ruleset for each requested varga. The following are examples of how the rules would be defined.Hora Chart (D-2): This chart is based on dividing each sign into two halves. The rules are conditional: for planets in an odd-numbered sign (Aries, Gemini, etc.), the first half (0 to 15 degrees) goes to the Hora of the Sun, and the second half (15 to 30 degrees) goes to the Hora of the Moon. For planets in an even-numbered sign (Taurus, Cancer, etc.), the first half goes to the Hora of the Moon, and the second half goes to the Hora of the Sun.Drekkana Chart (D-3): The Drekkana divides each sign into three 10-degree portions. A planet in the first 10 degrees is placed in the sign of the same lord. If in the second 10 degrees, it is placed in the sign of the lord of the fifth sign from the original. If in the last 10 degrees, it goes to the lord of the ninth sign from the original.Navamsha Chart (D-9): The Navamsha divides each sign into nine equal parts. The calculation involves a specific starting point for each type of sign (fiery, earthy, airy, watery) and then a linear progression. This is a foundational varga for analyzing relationships and fortune.Shastiamsha Chart (D-60): The Shastiamsha divides each sign into 60 equal parts. Due to its high resolution, this chart is highly sensitive to the precise birth time. The calculation requires a lookup table to determine the lordship for each one-half degree of a sign. This demonstrates the critical dependence of high-resolution charts on input precision.The system will generate all requested divisional charts (D-2, D-3, D-4, D-5, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-9, D-10, D-11, D-12, D-16, D-20, D-24, D-27, D-30, D-40, D-45, D-60) using this universal algorithm, each with its own specific ruleset.A crucial, often-overlooked, intermediate step is the generation of a Vaiseshikamsas table. This table summarizes a planet's dignity (e.g., exaltation, own sign, friendly sign) across the 16 varga charts. This is not a chart in itself but a data structure that serves as a direct input for the subsequent ShadBala and Vimsopaka calculations. The system must create this table before proceeding to those strength analyses.Section 3: Advanced Computational Metrics and Derived TablesThis section details the most complex and computationally intensive components of the system, which rely on the foundational and divisional data to produce sophisticated metrics of planetary strength, relationships, and influence.The Ashtakvarga SystemThe Ashtakvarga system provides a unique method for assessing the strength of each sign relative to the planets. The process involves multiple steps, from the granular to the aggregate.Ashtakvarga TableThe initial step is to build a 7x12 matrix known as the Ashtakvarga Table. This table records the benefic points (bindus) contributed by each of the seven classical planets (Sun through Saturn) to the twelve signs. Each planet's contribution is based on a specific set of rules, where certain signs are considered benefic relative to that planet's own position. The pseudo-code for this function iterates through each of the seven planets and, based on its position, places a bindu in the appropriate signs.SAV (Sarvashtakavarga)Once the individual Ashtakvarga contributions are calculated, the Sarvashtakavarga (SAV) is generated. This is a simple aggregation: the columns of the Ashtakvarga Table are summed to produce a single row of 12 numbers, representing the total benefic points each sign receives from all seven planets. The SAV is a critical intermediate output, and its generation depends directly on the Ashtakvarga Table.Sodhaya Enter TableThe Sodhaya Pinda Table is a complex, multi-stage calculation that refines the SAV data. The pseudo-code for this must be highly detailed. It begins with a reduction of the SAV based on specific astrological rules. This reduced SAV is then multiplied by the individual rupas (units of strength) of the planets, resulting in the Rasi Pinda. This is further combined with the Graha Pinda, which is the total of planetary rupas. The final Sodhaya Pinda values are derived through a final series of reductions, producing a highly refined metric that is used in advanced predictive techniques.Planetary Strength and Dignity (ShadBala)ShadBala is a composite measure of planetary strength, consisting of six distinct components. The calculation for ShadBala is one of the most involved in the entire system, as it synthesizes data from almost all preceding calculations. The final Planet Shadbala Table aggregates these six strengths into a single, comprehensive score.Sthan Bala (Positional Strength): This component depends on a planet's dignity in both the natal chart and the varga charts. A planet gains points for being in its own sign, exaltation sign, or a friendly sign. A significant portion of this calculation requires the Vaiseshikamsas table, which tracks a planet's dignity across all 16 Shodashvargas, demonstrating a direct dependency on the calculations in Section 2.Dig Bala (Directional Strength): This is a house-based calculation where planets gain strength based on their placement in a specific direction. For example, Jupiter and Mercury gain full Dig Bala in the first house (East), while Venus and Moon gain strength in the fourth house (North). This is determined by the Chalit Table (house placement).Kaal Bala (Temporal Strength): This component is highly dependent on the time of birth. It factors in whether the birth occurred during the day or night, the phase of the Moon (waxing or waning), and the Hora (hour) of the day.Chestha Bala (Motional Strength): This measures a planet's strength based on its motion, with points awarded for retrograde motion or when a planet is fast-moving.Naisargik Bala (Natural Strength): This is a fixed, inherent strength for each planet, with Jupiter being the strongest and the Moon being the weakest. This is a constant value that is added to the final score.Drig Bala (Aspectual Strength): This component assesses a planet's strength based on the aspects it receives from other planets. Benefic aspects add strength, while malefic aspects reduce it. The pseudo-code for Drig Bala must call the Planetary Aspects calculation to determine the nature and strength of the aspects received.The final Planet Shadbala Table is generated by summing the scores from all six components, converting them into rupas, and presenting the final strength score alongside the IshtaPhala (auspicious strength) and KashtaPhala (inauspicious strength).Inter-Planetary Relationships and AspectsThe relationships between planets are fundamental to astrological analysis. The system needs to calculate three distinct types of planetary relationships.Permanent Friendship Table: This is a static, foundational table based on the classical relationships between planets. For example, the Sun is a permanent friend of the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter. This table is a constant and does not change based on a birth chart.Temporal Friendship Table: This relationship is dynamic and depends on the house placement of planets relative to each other. A planet is considered a temporary friend to another if it is located in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th, or 12th house from it.Five-fold Friendship Table: This is a synthesis of the permanent and temporal tables, creating a nuanced relationship scale from "Exalted Friend" to "Exalted Enemy." The logic for this function involves combining the two preceding tables. For example, if a planet is a permanent friend and a temporal friend, it becomes an "Exalted Friend." If it is a permanent friend but a temporal enemy, it becomes "Neutral".For planetary aspects, the system must handle both Western (orb-based) and Vedic aspect calculations, as requested by the user. Western aspects, like conjunctions and trines, are calculated based on the angular separation of planets within a certain orb. Vedic aspects are either whole-sign aspects or special aspects (e.g., Mars aspects the 4th and 8th houses from its position). The pseudo-code must detail these distinct calculation methods. The user's request for Aspects On Bhav Madhya and Aspects On KP Cusp tables suggests a need to check for aspects not only on signs but also on the precise degrees of house cusps, a key detail for accurate analysis.Vimsopaka Bala and VaiseshikamsasVimsopaka Bala is a measure of planetary strength based entirely on a planet's dignity across a specific set of varga charts.The process begins with the Vaiseshikamsas Table, which tracks the dignity of each planet in the requested varga charts (Dasa Varga, Shodasa Varga, etc.). A planet gains a specific score for occupying its exaltation, Moolatrikona, or own sign in each varga. This table is the direct result of the GenerateVargaChart function from Section 2. The Vimsopaka calculation then takes this raw data and applies a specific weighting to each varga based on the chosen group (e.g., Shad Varga, Sapta Varga, etc.). The final Vimsopaka score is a weighted sum of a planet's dignity points, providing a second major metric of planetary strength that is independent of the ShadBala calculation.Section 4: A Synthesized High-Level Process Flow and Data Model SummaryThis section consolidates the entire technical specification, providing a final blueprint for implementation. The preceding sections detailed the individual components, and this section illustrates their interconnections and the overall data flow, which is a crucial part of a complete system design.The Master Function: GenerateAstrologyReport()The final master function, as detailed in Section 1, serves as the definitive architecture. It is a single entry point that orchestrates the entire sequence of operations. This function's value lies not in its internal complexity, but in its ability to manage the intricate dependency chain, ensuring that foundational data is calculated before it is used to build complex metrics. The modular design allows for future expansion or modification of any single component without impacting the rest of the system.Recommended Data Structures SummaryA well-defined data model is essential for a machine-readable output.
