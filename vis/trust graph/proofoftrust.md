Durity: Proof-of-Trust Protocol Whitepaper

Title: Scaling Trust Through Attestable Human Interaction

Version: 1.0Date: 30-04-2025Authors: Durity Protocol Team

1. Abstract

Durity introduces the Proof-of-Trust Protocol (PoT)—a new cryptographic and social-verification primitive designed to scale trust across decentralized, privacy-first systems. While most decentralized infrastructures focus on transaction validity, Durity's PoT focuses on relational and intent-based legitimacy. It encodes real-world interactions—such as mentorship, consent, delegation, and expertise—into verifiable, portable, and revocable attestations, forming a robust trust layer for next-generation AI agents, digital identities, and sovereign interactions.

2. Introduction

Modern digital networks are plagued by systemic trust failures: impersonation, misinformation, invisible surveillance, and non-consensual data use. Blockchain protocols solve some aspects of financial and operational trust, but fail to capture the subjective, evolving, and context-sensitive nature of human trust.

Durity’s Proof-of-Trust Protocol proposes a solution:

Encapsulate trust relationships into cryptographically signed and encrypted claims.

Enable their verification, delegation, revocation, and expiration without revealing private content.

Build a contextual, dynamic, and decentralized trust graph that agents and apps can query in real time.

3. Core Components

3.1 Attestations

An attestation is a structured, signed declaration from one party about another. Examples:

"Alice mentored Bob from Jan–June 2025."

"Ravi has cleared Options Level 3 with 91% accuracy."

"Priya authorized Aegis to manage her calendar."

Each attestation includes:

Issuer and subject identifiers

Timestamp and validity window

Context metadata (domain, purpose, scope)

Cryptographic signature

Optional encryption layer for privacy

3.2 Contextual Trust Scores

Trust is not a monolith—it is specific to domains and interactions. Durity allows:

Trust to be computed differently for different contexts (e.g., finance, health, legal)

Attestations to carry domain tags and context markers

Trust scores to be inferred, not imposed, from the attestation network

3.3 Consent Proofs

Every share, delegation, or interaction that modifies trust is logged as a consent event:

"Raj allowed Dr. Shah to access his medical records for 72 hours."

"Zara revoked calendar access from her assistant."

Consent logs are verifiable and linked to specific attestations.

3.4 Trust Horizon

Every trust relationship can decay or expire:

Time-bound trust (e.g., a security training badge valid for 1 year)

Event-bound trust (e.g., valid until task is complete or person resigns)

Attestations carry a trust horizon field to define this behavior.

3.5 Zero-Knowledge Bridge

Durity integrates zero-knowledge proof systems to allow users to:

Prove possession of valid attestations without revealing contents

Share only what’s necessary for verification

Maintain privacy-preserving trust as a first-class feature

4. Protocol Architecture

4.1 Infrastructure

Durity runs on a peer-to-peer mesh using libp2p, with encrypted storage and dynamic routing. The architecture avoids central servers and maintains zero-byte data footprint at the protocol level.

4.2 Identity Layer

Based on W3C Verifiable Credentials and DID (Decentralized Identifiers)

Optional integration with biometrics or hardware keys for stronger anchoring

4.3 Trust Graph

Formed dynamically as attestations accumulate

Queried by apps, agents, or other users to assess role legitimacy, competence, or history

Structured as a verifiable, signed DAG with optional public exposure of trust fingerprints

4.4 Revocation & Update

Every attestation is revocable by the issuer or through consensus rules

Expiry rules and mutation logs maintain forward integrity

5. Applications

5.1 AI Agents

AI agents operating on behalf of users must present PoT-based credentials:

"Aegis is trusted to handle banking tasks for Amit"

"This agent passed ethical training from X"

5.2 Financial Expertise (Options Judge)

Traders’ skill, strategy execution, and prediction accuracy can be attested and verified:

Trust scores drive access to higher challenges or capital

Fraud prevention and mentor matchmaking improve dramatically

5.3 Digital Legacy

Assign and validate roles (executor, legal guardian, successor) through formal attestations:

Eliminates fraud

Enables family-based cryptographic delegation

5.4 Cybercrime Protection

Enable granular trust-based access for vulnerable users:

"Only my son can approve suspicious calls"

"Allow this agent to warn me if I receive a phishing link"

7. Governance

PoT protocols will be governed through:

Open-source specification bodies (similar to W3C model)

Community-driven attestation schemas

Revocation registries and decentralized dispute resolution mechanisms

8. Conclusion

Durity's Proof-of-Trust Protocol offers a new foundation for digital trust, not just in data or systems, but between humans, agents, and institutions. It enables a future where trust is no longer assumed, promised, or gamed—but verifiably earned, shared, and scaled.

Durity does not just build on trust—it is the trust layer itself.
