Visvah Trust Graph Protocol (TGP)
Version 0.3 — Draft
1. Introduction
The Visvah Trust Graph Protocol (TGP) is a decentralized, interoperable framework designed to represent, verify, and scale trust relationships across individuals, organizations, and digital entities. By transforming trust into a portable, programmable, and context-aware data layer, TGP empowers users to coordinate, govern, and exchange value without relying on centralized authorities. Integrated with VitalInfos' SOUL Framework and VISDOM Data Operating System, TGP aligns with the mission to scale human potential by fostering trust as a foundational element of organized, unified living and limitless potential.
Core Belief: Power flows where trust goes.TGP makes trust measurable, transferable, and sovereign, enabling new paradigms of collaboration, governance, and personal empowerment.
Objectives:

Create a decentralized trust layer that replaces siloed, centralized verification systems.
Enable context-aware trust scoring for diverse domains (e.g., financial advice, health, governance).
Ensure user sovereignty over trust data with privacy-preserving technologies.
Integrate seamlessly with VitalInfos' ecosystem (VISDOM, SAFE Agent, Vis Coins, VISDAO).

2. Problem Statement
Current trust and identity systems face significant limitations:

Centralized Control: Platforms like banks, social media, or marketplaces own user trust and identity data, limiting user control.
Fragmentation: Trust earned in one context (e.g., a marketplace rating) is not portable to others (e.g., professional networks).
Shallow Signals: Binary "verified" badges lack depth, failing to convey why or how trust was earned.
Lack of Portability: Trust is non-transferable across platforms, forcing users to rebuild reputation repeatedly.
Privacy Risks: Centralized systems expose sensitive data, and users lack granular control over sharing.
Sybil and Fraud Vulnerabilities: Weak mechanisms for detecting fake identities or malicious actors.

TGP addresses these by creating a decentralized, context-aware Trust Graph that anyone can read, verify, and contribute to, without reliance on a single owner or server.
3. Core Concepts
3.1 Trust Graph
The Trust Graph is a directed, weighted, signed graph where:

Nodes: Represent identities (individuals, organizations, DAOs, devices) identified by Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).
Edges: Represent trust statements (e.g., "I trust Alice for financial advice with a score of 0.82").
Weights: Trust scores normalized on a 0–1 scale, reflecting strength of trust.
Metadata: Includes context (domain), issuance/expiry timestamps, and proofs of interaction (e.g., transaction hashes, verifiable credentials).

3.2 Trust Domains
Trust is inherently contextual. TGP organizes trust into domains to ensure relevance and precision. Examples include:

Financial Trust: Trust in investment advice, lending, or fiscal responsibility.
Professional Trust: Trust in skills, reliability, or project delivery.
Social Trust: Trust in ethical behavior, community contributions, or relationships.
Health Trust: Trust in medical advice or caregiving expertise.

Each domain has its own scoring logic, ensuring trust is evaluated in context (e.g., high trust in health advice does not imply trust in financial strategy).
3.3 Proof of Trustworthiness (PoT)
PoTs are verifiable claims or attestations that support trust edges. They are cryptographically signed and linked to specific interactions. Examples:

Government-issued KYC credentials.
DAO reputation scores or governance participation records.
On-chain transaction histories (e.g., successful deliveries, payments).
Verifiable credentials (VCs) for education, certifications, or employment.
Community feedback or ratings tied to specific interactions.

3.4 Trust Sovereignty
Users control their trust data, deciding which edges to share, revoke, or expire. TGP uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and selective disclosure to ensure privacy while maintaining verifiability.
4. Protocol Architecture
4.1 Identity Layer

Standard: Based on W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
Key Management: Each identity has a keypair for signing trust edges. Keys can be rotated without breaking trust history by linking to historical proofs.
Integration: Syncs with VitalInfos' ID Verification Layer (Guard stage) and VISDOM for seamless identity management.

4.2 Graph Storage
TGP employs a hybrid storage model to balance decentralization, scalability, and user control:

Local-First Storage: Users store their trust edges locally (e.g., mobile wallet, edge device) using encrypted storage.
Distributed Replication: Trust edges are replicated over a peer-to-peer network (libp2p/IPFS) for redundancy and availability.
Blockchain Anchoring: Merkle roots of trust edge batches are periodically committed to a minimal, high-security blockchain for immutability and tamper resistance.
Query Layer: A decentralized query protocol allows nodes to retrieve trust paths without exposing sensitive data.

4.3 Trust Edge Format
Trust edges are structured as JSON objects, cryptographically signed for integrity. Example:
{
  "from": "did:visvah:abc123",
  "to": "did:visvah:def456",
  "domain": "investment.advice",
  "trust_score": 0.82,
  "attestations": [
    "hash_of_proof1",
    "hash_of_proof2"
  ],
  "context": {
    "interaction_type": "financial_consulting",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-11T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "issued_at": "2025-08-11T12:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-08-11T12:00:00Z",
  "signature": "ed25519:xyz789..."
}


Fields:
from/to: DIDs of the trustor and trustee.
domain: Contextual domain of trust (e.g., investment.advice).
trust_score: Normalized score (0–1).
attestations: Hashes of supporting PoTs (e.g., VCs, transaction records).
context: Metadata about the interaction (e.g., type, timestamp).
issued_at/expires_at: Validity period of the trust edge.
signature: Cryptographic signature to ensure authenticity.



4.4 Trust Resolution Algorithm
The algorithm computes trust between two parties, even without direct interaction, using weighted pathfinding:

Direct Trust: Score from immediate trust edges between parties.
Network Trust: Aggregated score from indirect paths (e.g., A trusts B, B trusts C).
Path Decay: Trust weakens with distance (number of hops) and time since attestation.
Domain Relevance: Scores are adjusted based on domain alignment (e.g., financial trust does not influence health trust).

Simplified Formula:
Trust(A → C) = max(DirectTrust(A → C), 
                   Σ [Trust(A → B) × Trust(B → C) × PathDecay(Distance, Time)])


PathDecay: Exponential decay function based on hop count and time elapsed.
Aggregation: Weighted average of all valid paths, capped by domain relevance.

4.5 Data Privacy

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): Enable verification of trust scores without revealing underlying data (e.g., prove trust score > 0.7 without showing edge details).
Selective Disclosure: Users share only specific edges or aggregated scores.
Consent Registry: Tracks data usage and allows revocation of shared edges.

5. Trust Score Computation
Trust scores are computed dynamically based on:

Direct Trust: Explicit trust edges from the trustor to the trustee.
Network Trust: Indirect trust paths, weighted by path length and attestation strength.
Domain Weighting: Scores are adjusted for domain relevance (e.g., financial trust does not boost social trust).
Temporal Decay: Older attestations carry less weight, modeled as:Weight(t) = e^(-λ * (current_time - issued_at))

where λ is a domain-specific decay constant.
Attestation Quality: PoTs with stronger verification (e.g., government KYC) contribute more to the score.

Example Computation:

Alice trusts Bob (0.9) in investment.advice based on a successful consultation (PoT: transaction hash).
Bob trusts Charlie (0.8) in the same domain based on a verified credential.
Path decay reduces trust by 10% per hop.
Trust(Alice → Charlie) = 0.9 × 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.648 (network trust score).

6. Security & Anti-Abuse Measures
TGP incorporates robust mechanisms to prevent fraud, Sybil attacks, and abuse:

Sybil Resistance:
Nodes require multiple independent trust attestations (e.g., from distinct domains or high-trust nodes) to gain influence.
Proof-of-Stake (via Vis Coins) or proof-of-interaction requirements for node activation.


Edge Signing: All trust edges are cryptographically signed to prevent tampering.
Contextual Trust: Limits cross-domain abuse (e.g., high trust in social domain cannot be misused in financial domain).
Revocation Registry: Users can revoke or expire trust edges, with changes propagated to the network.
Rate Limiting: Caps the frequency of trust edge creation to prevent spam.
Community Feedback Loop: Integrates with VISDOM and SAFE Agent to flag suspicious patterns (e.g., rapid edge creation).

7. Use Cases
TGP enables a wide range of applications, aligning with the SOUL Framework's stages.

These are informed by analyses of SSI implementations, trust frameworks, and real-world deployments.<grok:render card_id="8e1358" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">16<grok:render card_id="4456e9" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">17<grok:render card_id="bbf322" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">18<grok:render card_id="ecb964" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">21<grok:render card_id="a4f6e6" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">23<grok:render card_id="16391b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">24<grok:render card_id="a9568a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">25<grok:render card_id="1369cc" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">26<grok:render card_id="202944" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">29
11.1 Best Practices

Adopt SSI Standards Rigorously: Ensure full compliance with W3C DIDs and VCs for interoperability. Use trust frameworks and registries to define governance rules, enabling machine-readable policies for automated trust verification.
Prioritize User-Centric Design: Abstract complexities (e.g., DIDs, ZKPs) behind intuitive interfaces in tools like SAFE Agent. Provide educational resources to empower users in managing their trust data.
Enhance Privacy Mechanisms: Implement ZKPs for all sensitive disclosures and conduct regular privacy audits. Use selective disclosure as default to minimize data exposure.
Optimize for Scalability: Employ Layer 2 blockchain solutions for anchoring to reduce costs and latency. Cache frequent trust queries and prune expired edges to maintain performance.
Incentivize Ethical Behavior: Balance Vis Coins rewards with penalties (e.g., token burns) for misuse. Tie incentives to verifiable PoTs to promote genuine trust-building.
Foster Ecosystem Partnerships: Collaborate with enterprises, DAOs, and civic bodies early to seed the graph with high-quality data, accelerating network effects.

11.2 Addressing Challenges

Scalability and Performance: Counter computational intensity by distributing queries via edge computing (e.g., LifOS) and limiting graph depth in resolutions.
Sybil and Fraud Risks: Strengthen detection with AI pattern analysis (via SAFE Agent) and require multi-source attestations for node activation. Regularly update decay functions to devalue outdated trust.
Regulatory Compliance: Develop a compliance toolkit for GDPR/CCPA, including consent logs and data minimization. Engage legal experts for domain-specific regulations (e.g., health data under HIPAA equivalents).
Adoption Barriers: Launch gamified onboarding and pilot programs in high-impact areas like supply chains or DAOs to demonstrate value. Monitor user feedback through VISDAO for iterative improvements.
Bias and Fairness: Establish guidelines for scoring to prevent domain biases, using diverse PoTs and community governance to ensure equitable trust evaluation.

These recommendations position TGP for robust, ethical deployment, aligning with SSI principles of user control, transparency, and security.
12. Future Considerations

Astrology/Human Design Integration: Enhance SAFE Agent's trust scoring with astrological or behavioral data for personalized trust insights.
Cross-Chain Interoperability: Support trust anchors on multiple blockchains for broader adoption.
AI-Driven Trust Analysis: Use machine learning to detect fraud patterns and optimize trust score computation.
Open Schema Explorer: Develop a public tool for exploring and validating TGP schemas.
Real-World Partnerships: Collaborate with civic bodies, DAOs, or enterprises to integrate TGP into real-world trust systems.
