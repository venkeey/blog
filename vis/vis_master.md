üìò VIS Ecosystem: Master Feature & Architecture Document

This is the Source of Truth for all VitalInfos (VIS) projects‚Äîacross identity, personal data, security, cybercrime, DAO structures, Super Agents, and more. Every domain, protocol, and architecture below maps to the SOUL framework and supports the broader vision of Visvah, the Trust Graph protocol.

DAO governance recommendation

Digital twin simulation for life decisions

‚òéÔ∏è 4. Durity Caller ID + OTP Verifier

Goal: Replace Android Caller ID with a verified, purpose-tagged system

Features:

Verified caller details: Name, Org, Role, Location

Purpose tagging: Sales, OTP, Reminder, Fraud Risk

User response: Accept, reject, schedule, respond with message

OTP Detection with Purpose Context: e.g., ‚ÄúPolicy Login OTP‚Äù

Enterprise Onboarding: Businesses pre-register employee contact & roles

Trust System: Caller trust score based on behavior, feedback

üîê 5. ID Verification Layer (Guard Stage)

Function: Verifiable ID system using DIDs + Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Use Cases:

Proof of income bracket, not salary

Share medical credentials without health history

One-click login via verified identity payload

Tools:

Mobile wallet for credentials

VISDOM sync for updates

Integration:

Durity

Visvah Trust Graph

Aegis (for personal agent decisions)

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 6. Cybercrime Prevention Suite (Guard + Gather)

Modules:

Spam & Scam Call Detection

WhatsApp Link & Image Scanner (phishing/malware)

Fraud Pattern Detection (bank transactions, trading patterns)

Trusted Interaction Graph: shows safest contact pathways

Powered By:

User-shared VISDOM streams (purchases, contacts)

AI + community feedback loop

Actions:

Alert

Auto-block

Send to SAFE for life impact scoring

üîÅ 7. Visvah (Trust Graph Protocol)

Tagline: Where trust flows and empowers all

Vision: A neutral, scalable trust protocol that replaces centralized authority with traceable, consent-based trust graphs

Core Components:

Nodes: Individuals, orgs, agents

Edges: Verifiable interactions + ratings (timestamped + purpose-tagged)

Reputation Trails: Dynamic trust scores per context

Applications:

Community membership eligibility

Influence or voting weight in DAO

Decentralized reputation-based access

ü™ô 8. Vis Coins (Incentive Layer)

Function: Fuel ecosystem alignment and incentivization

Token Roles:

Reputation stake for Visvah nodes

Rewards for verified, high-trust behavior

Payment for premium features (SAFE alerts, dashboards)

Burn mechanisms for misuse or spam

Governance Utility:

Voting on protocol-level decisions

Access levels to VISDOM features

üèõÔ∏è 9. VISDAO (Governance Layer)

Goal: Community-led evolution of all VIS tools and protocols

Stakeholders:

Individual users

Developers

Data holders

Identity verifiers

Governance Mechanics:

Quadratic voting or soul-bound stake

Proposal + Voting System (onchain)

SubDAOs for each SOUL stage or life domain

üîç 10. Other Domain-Specific VIS Projects

a. VisAge (ID for All Ages)

Simplified identity schema for children, elders

Use in education, healthcare, elderly caregiving

b. VISOR (OS for Realities)

Immersive OS for VR/AR devices backed by VISDOM

Powers productivity, learning, journaling in spatial environments

c. LifOS / SOMA (Self-Operating Model Architecture)

Embedded system + agent model that runs your life like an OS

Can run on edge devices or personal clouds

‚úÖ Future Considerations

Integrate astrology/Human Design into SAFE scoring engine

Build developer SDK for 3rd-party VIS-based apps

Launch open schema explorer & validator for VISDOM

Partner with civic bodies for Visvah-based reputation in real-world programs
